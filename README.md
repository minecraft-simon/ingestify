# Ingestify - Simplifying Data Ingestion (Concept)

**Ingestify** is a conceptual project aimed at simplifying the process of data ingestion for various document types. Please note that at this stage, Ingestify is an idea under development, and there is no functional software available. This Readme outlines the high-level concept and goals of the project.

## Concept

Ingestify is envisioned as a modular data ingestion pipeline that combines configurable rules and the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for document processing. While the project is in its conceptual phase, here are some key aspects of its proposed functionality:

- **Effortless Data Ingestion**: Ingestify aims to provide a seamless experience for users by offering a single endpoint or folder where documents can be deposited. The system would automatically initiate the ingestion process.

- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: The project envisions a web-based interface that allows users to define and manage document processing functions. These functions, which can be thought of as rules or functions, are designed to be highly configurable.

- **Configurable Functions**: Users can create functions that determine how documents should be processed. Each function specifies the input and output document types, offering flexibility in defining custom document types.

- **LLM Integration**: Ingestify plans to leverage large language models (LLMs) to analyze document content. These models can be employed for tasks such as content classification and summarization.

- **Error Handling**: Recognizing the potential for LLMs to make mistakes, Ingestify intends to incorporate error mitigation strategies. Documents processed by LLM-based functions might be flagged for human review to correct critical errors.

- **Continuous Learning**: The project aims to implement a feedback loop. When human reviewers correct LLM mistakes, the system would learn from these corrections over time, potentially improving accuracy.

- **API for Integration**: Ingestify's long-term vision includes offering an API for seamless integration with other systems. This would allow organizations to automate document processing as part of their workflows.

- **Event Emission**: Ingestify could potentially emit events to notify users when specific actions occur, such as the ingestion of new documents or changes in document types.

## Project Status

Please note that Ingestify is currently in the conceptual stage. There is no functional software, codebase, or deployed system available. This Readme serves as an outline of the project's goals and aspirations.
